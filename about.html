         <h5>MY STORY</h5>
       </div>
       <div class="col-lg-6">
<p> I grew up in an apartment behind the office of the Motel my parents run. I watched my parents struggle to keep up with the demands of their business--it was like a juggling act for them. My parents, immigrants from India, were very unfamiliar with technology, and I’ve been interested in technology since I was young. In the process of moving to the United States, they needed to learn how to read, write, and speak English. I felt that it was my role, being exposed to computers and native in English, to learn and translate to them how to use technology to help them with their small business. It was one of my earliest responsibilities. As I grew up I taught them how to use software like Excel, Word, and helped make their business more efficient. As I got older, I helped them integrate an online reservation system software into their business. I’ve seen first hand how technology makes life easier, helping them improve the efficiency of their business has also helped improve their quality of life. Looking forward, being versed in technology and programming will enable me to continue helping improve their business and quality of life. I understand how technology helps less privileged members of society succeed. <br><br>

My passion for computer science started during my freshman year, that's when I got into programming and started teaching myself web development using free online courses and tools. I was entranced. I could dive into projects and allow myself to get into my zone, hours would fly by as I worked on my projects. I can spend days trying to solve a complex problem, and even when I can’t seem to find a solution, I push through because I want to feel that moment when I solve the problem, and feel that instant rush of joy and excitement. It’s indescribable, you have to feel it to understand it. I knew this was something I wanted to pursue as a career.<br><br>

Since then, I have been learning other coding languages such as SQL, Java, and Swift. Coding has become my comfort zone. Computer science helps me build something out of nothing that could not only help others, but can change our everyday life. With the power of computer science you can create software that makes life easier for the people around, and that concept is why I believe computer science is such a useful, and fantastic skill to have. I’m inspired by how broad a reach technology has. Even parents like mine, unfamiliar with english, want and need to incorporate programs into their business to enhance efficiency. <br><br>

I’m from a small town with limited resources for technology courses. It’s often hard to find teachers who are versed enough in computer science to help guide me. I do find online resources, like stack overflow, that I can turn to when I’m stuck on a problem. But, I was fortunate enough to attend a bootcamp over the summer in San Francisco, California, which was really essential in helping me find teachers that can guide me.  I’ve found a few people I can turn to, like Karly,  my camp computer science professor, or Jose Ramirez , my professor who taught me swift at a IOS development bootcamp I went to over the summer. These two professors are people that I can go to if I need assistance in computer science or I ever want to learn more. These two professors have helped me grow as a programmer and a student.<br><br>

I want to become an innovator, people are waiting to be helped. I want to use my skills and passion for computer science to make the world more efficient, and I want to be able to create products that people like my parents can use. Products that are more accessible to those who don’t have access to the tools that more privileged people may have had. <br><br>
