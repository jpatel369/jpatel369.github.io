         <h5>MY STORY</h5>
       </div>
       <div class="col-lg-6">
<p> It's funny how people can accidentally discover their passions. Like Debbi Fields who started baking cookies in college to release stress, when she realized her passion for baking, she turned it into a little business. As her business grew the small bakery turned into Mrs.Fields, the famous bakery chain. I discovered my passion through a club that had nothing to do with my passion. My passion is computer science. It makes me feel like an innovator and allows me to be creative, but everyone needs help. Debbi looked to her husband for guidance on the business.  When I need help, I turn to my programming teachers in San Francisco. <br/><br/>

My journey started freshman year in high school. CS was not something I was not interested in but got into because I had to choose an event to compete in for my FBLA club (Future Business Leaders of America).  I choose programming because everything else was uninteresting and required writing papers or power points.  My task was to actually make something, a website.  Of course, I did not know a single thing about programming. As usual, I turned to google for my problem and stumbled onto a few a solutions.  I found free online programming courses and ended up making an okay website.  Surprisingly, I placing top 10 in the State FBLA competition for my event.  It was very exciting!  The following school year I signed up for a programming class in school. <br/><br/>

Programming started off as a hobby my 9th-grade year, but it turned into a passion after three years of online and classroom courses. I learned three other programming languages (SQL, Java, and Swift).  Programming went from being something challenging to a skill that I could use to build and get creative with.  I started making little apps, one of which was purely to help my mom save receipts.  I had no expectations but the app ended up getting 700 downloads on the app store.  It felt like I just placed top 10 ten again! I was happy to see that people around the world were using my app to improve their wallet size and life.  This was very impactful on me, I realized how broad of a reach technology could really have.  After this experience, programming not only lets me be creative but it also made me feel like an innovator in some way. <br/><br/>

My only problem in high school was that I was stuck in a small town.  It was difficult to find programming teachers or mentors.  I started looking for a solution (on google) but everything software related seemed to be in San Francisco…  Growing up, my father always told us stories about how he moved to America so that my brother and I could get a better education.  When I told him I wanted to go to San Francisco for classes, he was not so thrilled about me getting an “education”.  It took the help of two older cousins, weeks of planning and long phone calls with family to finally convince him to let me go.  I attended a nine-week programming boot camp the summer of my junior year and it was the best thing I have ever done!  The course was difficult and most people in the class had already graduated college but I got through it successfully. This is where I made my app.  I also found the mentors that I needed, Karly Zhuginissova and Jose Ramirez, my computer science professors.  They are the people that I turn to when I need real advice and mentoring.
In the beginning, I did not think that making a simple website for an FBLA competition would lead me anywhere.  It’s funny how small things like taking a few online programming courses can build on themselves over time. The next thing I knew, I was attending a computer science boot camp in San Francisco and had an app in the app store with over 700 downloads.  Maybe like Debbie Fields, I will have my own successful ventures in the future, free cookies with every app. <br/>
